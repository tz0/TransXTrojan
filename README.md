### A few quick tips
Triggering transient execution for attacks often requires matching patterns.  Depends on the side/covert-channel in your exploits, some attack effects could be 'delicate' that, sometimes, the 'cleaner' environment (e.g., fixed CPU freq., iso-ed cores, etc.) the better attack rates.  

Please find readme in every subdirectory and grasp the idea before 'attacking' (your own machines).  Although all the PoCs and the standalone demos are tested, they are better to be used as examples to facilitate your understanding. A working attack may require your own modification in code, alignment, or even kernel.
